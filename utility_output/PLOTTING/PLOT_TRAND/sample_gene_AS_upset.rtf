Alternative splicing in genes \b0 \line Number of genes with the specified types of alternative splicing indicated by the black dots below the histogram of gene counts (n = 7386 multi-transcript genes). The box plot represent the number of transcripts per gene (blue). Genes with "No Shared NT" have a pair of transcripts with nonoverlapping coordinates.
