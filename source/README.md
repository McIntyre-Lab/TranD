TranD is the next evolution of the concepts in the Event Analysis
(https://github.com/McIntyre-Lab/events), but simplified for the task of comparing data produced by
sequence alignment and annotation tools.

This program takes a single GTF file and performs all pairwise transcript comparisons within each
gene or two GTF files for transcript comparisions between genes in both datasets, reads in exonic
fragment data, and performs event analysis to determine transcript distance measures for the genes
and transcripts in the data.
