Alternative splicing in genes \b0 \line Number of genes with the specified types of alternative splicing indicated by the black dots below the histogram of gene counts (n = 172 multi-transcript genes). Box plots represent the number of transcripts per gene (blue) and the average number (orange) and proportion (green) of nucleotides different between the pairs of transcripts within the gene. Genes with "No Shared NT" have a pair of transcripts with nonoverlapping coordinates. Transcriptome comparisons performed by TranD [1]. \line \line 1. Nanni A., et al. (2021).
