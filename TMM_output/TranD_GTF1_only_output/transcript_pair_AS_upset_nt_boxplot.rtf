Alternative splicing between pairs of transcripts \b0 \line Number of transcript pairs with the specified types of alternative splicing indicated by the black dots below the histogram of transcript pair counts (n = 43 transcript pairs, in 2 multi-transcript genes). Box plots represent the number (blue) and proportion (orange) of nucleotides different between the pair. Transcript pairs with "No Shared NT" have nonoverlapping coordinates.
