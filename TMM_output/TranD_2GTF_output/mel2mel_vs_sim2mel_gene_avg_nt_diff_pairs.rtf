Number of nucleotides different between reciprocal and nonreciprocal minimum pairs \b0 \line Each point represents a gene plotted by the average number of nucleotides different between reciprocal minimum pairs (X-axis) and minimum pairs of extras without a reciprocal minimum pair (Y-axis). Genes are colored by categorizations of the comparison between mel2mel and sim2mel. Transcriptome analyses performed by TranD [1].  \line \line 1.
