Observed alternative splicing in genes among reciprocal minimum pairs of transcripts \b0 \line Number of genes with the specified types of alternative splicing in only reciprocal minimum pairs between mel2mel and sim2mel indicated by the black dots below the histogram of gene counts (n = 20 genes with 32 reciprocal minimum pairs). Box plots represent the number of reciprocal minimum pairs (blue) and the number of transcripts in mel2mel (orange) and sim2mel (green). Genes with "No Shared NT" have a pair of transcripts with nonoverlapping coordinates. Transcriptome analyses performed by TranD [1].  \line \line 1.
