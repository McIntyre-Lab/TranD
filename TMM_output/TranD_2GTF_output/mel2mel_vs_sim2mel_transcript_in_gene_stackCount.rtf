Classification of transcript pairs \b0 \line The stacked bar chart is the count of the number of genes in each category (N = 20). Columns are: genes with equal numbers of transcripts in mel2mel and sim2mel (Match; n = 8.0), genes with mel2mel containing more transcripts than sim2mel (mel2mel Greater; n = 11.0), and genes with sim2mel containing more transcripts than mel2mel (sim2mel Greater, n = 1.0). Genes with Reciprocal Pairs for all transcripts (Match) or as a complete subset are colored blue. Genes with at least one but not all transcript pairs are reciprocal minimum matches (Partial Reciprocal Pairs) are colored yellow. Genew with no pairs that are reciprocal minimum matches (No Reciprocal Pairs) are colored purple. Transcriptome analyses performed by TranD [1].  \line \line 1.
