Extra minimum pair alternative splicing \b0 \line Number of extra minimum pairs, or pairs without reciprocal minimums, with the specified types of alternative splicing between mel2mel and sim2mel indicated by the black dots below the histogram of pair counts (n = 37 total pairs). Pairs with no shared nucleotides are in the same genes but with nonoverlapping coordinates. Box plots of the number (blue) and proportion (orange) of nucleotide (NT) differences between the pairs represented in the histogram. Transcriptome analyses performed by TranD [1].  \line \line 1.
