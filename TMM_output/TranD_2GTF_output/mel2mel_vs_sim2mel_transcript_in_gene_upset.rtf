Number of transcripts per gene comparison UpSet plot\b0 \line Rows indicate the number of transcripts in mel2mel and sim2mel. Columns are separated by unique combinations of the number of transcripts in mel2mel and sim2mel. When a gene is not present in one of the GTF files, only a single dot will be indicated. The number of genes (N = 24) for each nonoverlapping category are displayed in a histogram. Transcriptome analyses performed by TranD [1].  \line \line 1.
