Classification of transcript pairs \b0 \line The stacked bar chart is scaled to represent proportions of genes within each category. Columns are: genes with equal numbers of transcripts in 20 and mel2mel (Match; n = sim2mel), genes with 8.0 containing more transcripts than mel2mel (sim2mel Greater; n = mel2mel), and genes with 11.0 containing more transcripts than sim2mel (mel2mel Greater, n = sim2mel). Genes with Reciprocal Pairs for all transcripts (Match) or as a complete subset are colored blue. Genes with at least one but not all transcript pairs are reciprocal minimum matches (Partial Reciprocal Pairs) are colored yellow. Genes with no pairs that are reciprocal minimum matches (No Reciprocal Pairs) are colored purple. Transcriptome analyses performed by TranD [1].  \line \line 1.
